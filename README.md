# Script to replace HTML links to images with local ones.
This script simply downloads all of the images in your html file and replaces them in a new file with those same images downloaded into a folder on your computer.

It will also create an images folder which contains the images, so they don't cause a huge mess on your computer.
## Usage
``python replace_img_links.py [input_file] [output_file]``
``python replace_img_links.py -h`` for help.
